# Portfolio Website

This is my personal **portfolio website**, built with **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**.  
It served as my first professional showcase and likely helped me land my first job as a Frontend Developer.
> **Note:** This portfolio is fully reusable and can be adapted as your own with modifications.  
> If you want a link to the Figma UI design, please contact me via email.
